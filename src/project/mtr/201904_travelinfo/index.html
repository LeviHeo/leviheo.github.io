        Since Google Maps is not available in China, I had to find a platform that could also be used in Hong Kong and China.
        Instead of Google Maps, amap (高德地圖) was used, which is a very influential online map platform in China.

        The MTR website has the same character as the government, it must comply with Web Accessibility. I follow the guidelines of the W3C
        Various web accessibility functions such as font adjustment and tab key movement were applied.
