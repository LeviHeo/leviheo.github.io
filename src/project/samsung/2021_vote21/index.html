        I enjoyed this project very much. Within a short development period, I had to prepare a lot of features and quality that would satisfy our clients.
        The draft prepared by the designer was a design that was not suitable for global guidelines and the web environment.
        I used this and worked on it while revising it to a size suitable for the web environment and a global guideline.

        The peculiarity was that the content was displayed on another server using Iframe.
        The use of iframes has many limitations, so there was a difficult part to handle this design.

        The popup menu and form are used in the current browser.
        API for form input is handle in the iframe.
        A lot of time has been invested in optimizing for iframes and cross domains.
